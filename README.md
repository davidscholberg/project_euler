# Project Euler

These are my solutions to the [Project Euler][project-euler-site] problem set. The solutions are written in a mixture of [Python][python] and [Cython][cython].

[python]: https://www.python.org/
[cython]: https://cython.org/

### Development Setup

* Get project source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidscholberg/project_euler.git
cd project_euler
```

* Create and enter [python virtual environment][python-venv].

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

* Build and install the project package as an [editable install][editable-install].
    * Note that this command will need to be run after every change to a cython file (`.pyx`) in order for the change to take effect. This does not apply to changes to python files.

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

* Install commit hook to run the unit tests on commit.

```bash
./install_commit_hooks
```

### Running Solutions

To run the solution for a particular problem, pass the problem number to the `solve` script:

```bash
solve 24
```

The `solve` script runs the solution and compares the computed answer against the correct answer, the list of which was obtained from [luckytoilet/projecteuler-solutions][projecteuler-solutions].

Note that the `solve` script is automatically generated by [setuptools][setuptools] as an [entry point][entry-point].

### Project Directory Structure

* [project_euler/][project-euler] - Main project package. All python/cython source files go in here.
    * [data/][data] - Input data for problems that have non-trivial input.
    * [solutions/][solutions] - Solution files, one per solution. Logic should be kept to a minimum here.
    * [util/][util] - Package where reusable logic resides. All code here should have unit tests.
* [install_commit_hooks][install-commit-hooks] - Script to install unit test commit hook.
* [test][test] - Script that runs all unit tests.
